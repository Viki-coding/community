<h2>Quality Assurance</h2>
User Experience Assurance - 

We took a systematic and structural approach to manually test each page to ensure it functions correctly and to help identify potential bugs. We created a specific testing template to ensure and re-check all aspects of the site were working correctly as specified with expected and actual outcomes using a methodical approach. We did final testing on the deployed site. 

<h2>Test Evaluation Sheet:</h2>
In the table below we performed methodical testing on the deployed site.

<h2>BUGS</h2>

<u>Unsolved Bugs</u>
UX Bug: New User Creation redirect to Book Event session

A new user views an event, decides they want to book the event, they click on book which redirects them to 'Create a User Profile', they create a user profile and get logged in but are returned to the user dashboard, I would prefer from a UX view for them to be re-directed back to the event they wanted to book. I checked the event_id in the session in the book_event view, I checked the redirect after create_community_user, I checked the login redirection in login_view.  It’s a bug that I would have preferred to fix but was unable to due to time constraints. 

<h3>Solved Bugs</h3>
I came across many bugs while creating the site, from missing semi-colons, bootstrap conflicting CSS, not collecting static, not doing a hard-refresh - all learning curves!  I put the HTML and CSS code and python and js through validators and fixed all warnings that were shown.  Having chrome development tool open while creating code and inspect console log was very helping with some aspects of the bug finding.  It was also helpful breaking down the problem and  thinking logically - what’s working, what’s not to be able to focus in on the issue.  My mentor advised me to install Flake8 and to keep an eye on my Problems tab in my terminal console - which I found very useful.  With all the bugs I tried to de-bug them myself, I decided to have the same concept of code institute and independently work on it for 30 mins and then I'd google it, YouTube, stack overflow and W3 schools were my saviour and good at explaining, but if I still was really stuck I would use Perplexity to help and point me in the right direction, and as a last resort tutor support. 

After following the step by step guide to migrating from GitPod to visual studio code, I found it difficult, lost my project kanban board, so I decided to start again rather than make the migration. Deploying to Heroku also took 1 full day to sort of, with many errors and google, stack overflow and slack to assist.  It was very frustrating at the time, loosing valuable coding hours trying to fix errors but each is a learning curve where you learn something new and get braver at writing commands to see if things get fixed.  In the end I had to resort to Oisin in student support who finally got me sorted! 

Summernote Bug - 
I followed the steps to install summernote. After running my server and appending /admin at the end I found it had not updated. I checked again to see if summernote was installed. I checked to see if it was in my installed apps. I checked to see it was in my projects urls.py file. I then checked the EventAdmin class was registered in my admin.py file. All was ok. I made migrations again and still did not make any changes. Then I right clicked to inspect and checked the console for javascript errors and found errors for the static files. Then I googled how to resolve this error and followed the steps which got it resolved. 

Check the File names Bug - style and styles! 
I applied styling to the page, but when I ran the server it was not applying the changes. I corrected by static files in settings.py as I had inserted staticfile_dirs twice. I checked my file paths, my style.css sheet was not in its own css folder under static so I amended it. I ran the python manage.py collect static command again and ran the server. Still didn't work. Then I saw it, in my file directory - I had style.css rather than styles.css

![styling not being applied to readmore bug](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb5ffc95-bb5e-4ce4-8da4-5c15e84f8558)

Made a lot of styling changes to the page, deployed to Heroku and the following was displayed.  Realised I had forgotten to collectstatic, went back into the terminal ran the command again and deployed successfully.

Facilitator log in bug, facilitator user not being redirected when username and password entered. When running server, got error module error not found in forms. Realised I had created the forms.py in the incorrect file path under community centre rather than under noticeboard app. Deleted forms.py under community centre. Bug still existed, so decided to create a separate login.html page for facilitators to log in to, corrected the views.py links. Checked that the users set up in Django were authorised as facilitators, created a new user called facilitator, ensured they had full permissions and facilitator status. Still unable to log on.  With tutor support, checked login_view function to realise  that after authentication is successful I should of re-directed them to create_event. After half a day of pulling my hair out - finally worked, good lesson learnt check Django documentation for tips!

JS Error - found in Chrome Development Tools
JavaScript error - while dev tools was open noticed I had a JS error, checked the file path in base.html to realise that I should of had script.js in its own JS folder. Corrected it and it ran fine. 

Facilitator Dashboard not displaying when facilitator logs in. 
Focused in on the logical step that my view.py for dashboard was incorrect, yellow error page highlighted the error, changed user to facilitator and error was resolved.

Integrity Error

![Integrity Error](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e1077be-1e0d-45d8-a79d-abe90963631b)

After I log in as a facilitator, it takes me to my dashboard, I choose to create an event, I enter the field details and when I click on submit I get Integrity Error. ![geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/integrityerror-in-django/) suggested 3 common reasons, 1. FK Violation, 2. Unique Constraint Violation and 3. Non-Null Field Violation. My yellow error message highlighted [null value in column "facilitator_id" of relation "noticeboard_event" violates not-null,constraint]. I realised that this was consistent with the above error and changed user to facilitator as that was a valid value in my model. I changed the edit and delete views to facilitator to ensure the error didn't happen again.

Log Out as Facilitator Error
I added the feature that once the facilitator was logged in, the button would change to log out. But when I clicked on log out it would bring me to the Django admin log out panel rather than my own customised one. 
Stack Overflow, credit/link below in credits. helped me amend the customised Django view and urls.py to my home page.

Facilitator Bookings Table 
I created a table on the facilitator dashboard so that the names, emails and phone numbers of the people who were booked were clearly displayed.  On smaller screens the table half disappeared horizontally. I made many changes but stack overflow advice helped to display it most clearly.

[Facilitator Logout View](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15467831/django-logout-redirects-me-to-administration-page#:~:text=If%20you%20are%20seeing%20the,admin%20comes%20after%20your_application%20.)
Helped to fix when a facilitator logs out, rather than seeing the Django admin panel log out I wanted the facilitator to see the customised page. 

My notice board excerpts were various lengths and then that was having an affect on my styling and pushing the text out of my notice board display cards.  I had to come up with a way of reducing down the amount of text in my excerpt. This website showed me some good filter techniques available. I used the slice method. (https://earthly.dev/blog/django-template-filters/)


When facilitator was logged it, they could view, edit and delete their own event, but when they left their dashboard and clicked on an event they did create, it was just showing the event without allowing them to edit. to fix this I amended by event_detail.html page to include {% if is_facilitator%} and included the hrefs to edit and delete. I also had to change the event_detail view to include is_facilitator. 

Bug: Time no longer displaying on event. I had made some changes to the time input fields as I wanted the facilitator to be understand to put in the 24hr clock.  When I amended my model to facilitate the bookings functionality I unfortunately made the error of changing the names of my 'start_time' to 'starttime' and 'end_time' to 'endtime', I changed it in some files and not in others, so I had to make sure the forms.py file was the same as my model.  

Bug Error: 'Django does not allow exists method in the template' I was trying to have the facilitator and user dashboard to appear in the navigation bar depending on who was logged in. When I did this it created a templateSyntaxError. To solve it I used a custom template filter and restarted my server. 
[Stack Overflow] (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40686201/django-1-10-1-my-templatetag-is-not-a-registered-tag-library-must-be-one-of)

Bug: Logged in as a community user. Booked an event. Went to Dashboard, but no booked events displayed. 
Resolved by looking at code and realising I had for booking in booking rather than booking in bookings to match what I had in my views. 

Bug: Bootstrap color over-riding the cream color I wanted in my nav bar. To fix it I first put !important beside it which failed to work, advice from stack overflow was 'specificity', adding another class to the rule.  This worked.
